# AUGIS-Surv

This repository contains example code which:

1. Trains Random Survival forests on multiply imputed data. (RSFtraining.R)

2. Will process externally collected data with the models available at uoscancer.shinyapps.io/AugisSurv. (externalvalid.R)



Code script 1 is not entirely self contained and will require editing if they are to work with other use cases.
